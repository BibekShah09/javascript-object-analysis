# Packed Vs Holey Array Performance
Holes are created in object backing stores if you delete it or donâ€™t define it. Creating holes in the array cause the engine to go through expensive table lookup in the prototype chain.

## Run
 ```sh
 node packed-vs-holey.js
 ```

### Output
```
   console.timeEnd: packedArray, 122033.288000
   console.timeEnd: holeyArray, 152669.351000
```
