# Object Analysis in Javascript
In JavaScript, Objects are mutable (alterable) data types. Created by literals and compared by reference,
JavaScript Objects are the collection of properties, mapping between keys and values.


### Performance factor â€” Property Access Time
Property access mechanism in strongly typed language
is different from dynamically typed language. In V8, the object has a hidden class associated with it which works similarly to fixed object layout in Java, except they are created at run time and updated dynamically as object changes.
